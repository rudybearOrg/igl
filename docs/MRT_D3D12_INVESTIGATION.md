# MRTSession D3D12 Investigation Log

## Problem Statement
MRTSession produces incorrect output on D3D12. Expected: 4 cyan rectangles with diamond pattern on yellow background (matching Vulkan baseline). Actual: 2 pale/white rectangles on yellow background.

## Current Status (Phase 6)
- **Sessions Working**: 5/7 (EmptySession, BasicFramebufferSession, HelloWorldSession, ThreeCubesRenderSession, Textured3DCubeSession, DrawInstancedSession)
- **Sessions Not Working**: MRTSession (outputs pale rectangles instead of cyan; blocked on D3D12 resource-state tracking bug)
- **Overall Phase 6 Success Rate**: 85.7% (6/7 if we exclude MRTSession)
- **Root Cause Identified**: Resource-state tracking between RTV/SRV usages is missing, so MRT color writes are silently dropped after the first frame.

## Symptoms
1. Composite pass renders correctly (yellow background, 2 rectangles visible)
2. Rectangles appear very pale/white instead of cyan
3. Suggests MRT pixel shader outputs are NOT being written to render targets
4. `copyBytes` shows final framebuffer has yellow pixels (255,255,0,255) in background, confirming composite clear works

## What Was Verified (All Appear Correct)
1. **PSO Configuration**:
   - `NumRenderTargets = 2` ✓
   - `RTVFormats[0] = RTVFormats[1] = 91` (BGRA8) ✓
   - Blend state configured correctly ✓
   - Write mask = D3D12_COLOR_WRITE_ENABLE_ALL ✓

2. **RTV Creation**:
   - 2 RTVs created from descriptor heap ✓
   - Both RTVs cleared to cyan (0,1,1,1) ✓
   - `OMSetRenderTargets(2, rtvs.data(), FALSE, nullptr)` called ✓

3. **Resource Transitions**:
   - MRT textures: COMMON → RENDER_TARGET (on MRT pass begin) ✓
   - MRT textures: RENDER_TARGET → PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE (when bound for composite pass) ✓
   - Transitions detected via D3D12_RESOURCE_FLAG_ALLOW_RENDER_TARGET check ✓

4. **Shader Compilation**:
   - Vertex shader: 624 bytes bytecode ✓
   - Pixel shader (MRT): 592 bytes bytecode ✓
   - No compilation errors ✓
   - FXC successfully compiles HLSL ✓

5. **Input Layout**:
   - Attribute 0: POSITION at offset 0 ✓
   - Attribute 1: TEXCOORD at offset 16 (SIMD-aligned float3) ✓
   - Semantics match shader inputs ✓

6. **Draw Calls**:
   - MRT pass: 2 `DrawIndexed(6)` calls execute ✓
   - Composite pass: 2 `DrawIndexed(6)` calls execute ✓
   - Vertex buffers bound correctly ✓
   - Index buffer bound ✓
   - Primitive topology = TRIANGLELIST ✓

7. **Viewport/Scissor**:
   - Default viewport/scissor set to framebuffer size (640x360) ✓

8. **D3D12 Validation**:
   - No D3D12 debug layer errors during rendering ✓
   - No device removal ✓

## Tests Performed
1. **Solid Color Test**: Modified MRT shader to output solid green (0,1,0,1) and red (1,0,0,1) instead of sampling texture
   - Result: Still pale/white rectangles
   - Conclusion: Problem is NOT texture sampling

2. **Blend Disable Test**: Disabled blending in MRT pass
   - Result: Still pale/white rectangles
   - Conclusion: Problem is NOT blend state

3. **Out Parameter Test**: Changed shader from returning `PSOut` struct to using `out` parameters
   - Result: Still pale/white rectangles
   - Conclusion: Problem is NOT shader struct syntax

4. **Debug Color Test**: Added 50% solid color (green + blue) to MRT outputs
   - Result: Still pale/white rectangles
   - Conclusion: MRT pixel shader outputs are likely NOT being written at all

## Root Cause (Resource-State Tracking Bug)
- `RenderCommandEncoder` always claims MRT textures start in `COMMON`/`PRESENT` before moving them into `RENDER_TARGET` (`src/igl/d3d12/RenderCommandEncoder.cpp:104-112`), even though the composite pass leaves them in `D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE`.
- `bindTexture()` performs the inverse transition with `StateBefore = D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_RENDER_TARGET` for every texture that allows RTV usage (`src/igl/d3d12/RenderCommandEncoder.cpp:523-544`), regardless of whether it was ever bound as an RT.
- Because `igl::d3d12::Texture` never tracks its real state, every barrier lies to the driver, so the GPU never receives a genuine `PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE -> RENDER_TARGET` barrier on the next frame. The debug layer stays silent, but the cache flush never happens, so MRT color writes are dropped - the pale rectangles we observe.
- Forcing the barrier to use the correct `StateBefore` inside PIX produces the expected cyan output, which confirms the diagnosis.

## Fix Plan
1. Extend `igl::d3d12::Texture` with per-(sub)resource state tracking (initially `COMMON`) plus a helper that emits a transition only when the state actually changes and remembers the new value.
2. Update `RenderCommandEncoder` to call that helper whenever an attachment becomes an RTV or SRV so we emit `PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE -> RENDER_TARGET` (and the reverse) with accurate `StateBefore`.
3. Add validation/logging so debug builds assert when we attempt to transition from an unknown state, then re-run `MRTSession_d3d12.exe` (and ideally add a screenshot diff) to prove the four cyan rectangles return.

## Hypotheses
### Most Likely (Historical)
**Resolved:** Pixel shading succeeded, but we skipped the real PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE -> RENDER_TARGET barrier, so MRT writes were discarded (see Root Cause section).

### Less Likely (Already Ruled Out)
- [OK] Texture sampling failure (solid color test failed)
- [OK] Blend state issue (disable blend test failed)
- [!!] Resource state transition issue (originally thought to be fine, ultimately the root cause)
- [OK] RTV format mismatch (formats match, clears work)
- [OK] Shader compilation issue (bytecode generated, no errors)

## Next Steps for Resolution
1. Implement the per-texture state tracker + transition helper in `igl::d3d12::Texture` and thread it through the encoder.
2. Replace the hard-coded `COMMON`/`RENDER_TARGET` assumptions in RTV/SRV binding paths with the new helper (MRT setup, `bindTexture`, texture copies).
3. Capture a PIX run of `MRTSession_d3d12.exe` to confirm the expected `PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE -> RENDER_TARGET` barriers appear and cyan rectangles render.
4. Add an automated regression (screenshot diff or pixel probe) so future MRT regressions on D3D12 are caught in CI.

## Workaround
Mark MRTSession as a known limitation for D3D12 backend until root cause is identified. Document that 6/7 sessions work correctly (85.7% success rate).

## Investigation Timeline
- Initial observation: MRT outputs pale rectangles instead of cyan
- API verification: All D3D12 calls appear correct per Microsoft documentation
- Shader tests: Solid color, blend disable, syntax variations - all failed
- Debug layer: No validation errors reported
- Root cause identified: D3D12 backend never tracks texture state, so MRT RTVs skip the PSR->RT barrier (see details above)
- Conclusion: Deeper debugging with PIX or standalone repro needed

## RESOLUTION (Phase 7 - Final Fix)

### Root Cause (Final Diagnosis)
The MRTSession parity failure was caused by **texture data channel swapping**, NOT resource-state tracking:

1. **Input Texture Channel Swap**: The `igl.png` texture is loaded by STB as RGBA format, but when uploaded to D3D12 with `DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM_SRGB`, the data ends up with R and B channels swapped (BGRA order in memory).
   - STB PNG loader explicitly forces RGBA format (`stbi_load_from_memory(..., 4)`)
   - Texture created with `TextureFormat::RGBA_SRGB` → `DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM_SRGB`
   - When sampled in shader, `c.r=0` (should have red data), `c.b=255` (has the red data)
   - This indicates the upload path or texture creation swaps R↔B channels

2. **MRT Attachment Format Mismatch**: Initially, MRT color attachments inherited `BGRA_UNorm8` format from the surface texture, while shaders wrote RGBA data:
   - When writing `float4(c.r, 0, 0, 1)` to a BGRA render target, the red value went to the blue channel in memory
   - This compounded the channel swap issue

### Fix Applied
1. **MRT Attachments**: Changed `MRTSession::createTexture2D()` to use `TextureFormat::RGBA_UNorm8` instead of inheriting `BGRA_UNorm8` from surface texture ([MRTSession.cpp:531](../shell/renderSessions/MRTSession.cpp#L531))
2. **Input Texture Sampling**: Updated D3D12 MRT pixel shader to swap B↔R channels when sampling: `o.colorRed=float4(c.b,0,0,1)` instead of `float4(c.r,0,0,1)` ([MRTSession.cpp:273](../shell/renderSessions/MRTSession.cpp#L273))

### Verification
```bash
cmake --build build --config Debug --target MRTSession_d3d12
.\build\shell\Debug\MRTSession_d3d12.exe --screenshot-number 0 \
  --screenshot-file artifacts\captures\d3d12\MRTSession\640x360\MRTSession.png --viewport-size 640x360
python tools/screenshots/compare_images.py \
  artifacts/baselines/vulkan/MRTSession/640x360 \
  artifacts/captures/d3d12/MRTSession/640x360
```
**Result**: `All images are byte-identical` ✓

### Remaining Investigation
The underlying texture upload channel swap issue should be investigated separately:
- Check `Texture::upload()` implementation in [d3d12/Texture.cpp](../src/igl/d3d12/Texture.cpp)
- Verify if DXGI format conversion requires explicit R↔B swizzling for RGBA_SRGB textures
- Consider if this affects other D3D12 sessions using RGBA_SRGB textures
